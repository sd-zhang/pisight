# PiSight

This is an adaptation of [Webcam Pi](https://www.github.com/elcalzado/webcampi) intended to be used alongside some components from the Apple iSight webcam. If you're interested in building this, follow this documentation and my YouTube video!

## Features

PiSight keeps all the core functionality of Webcam Pi while adding hardware integration and quality‑of‑life features specific to the Apple iSight enclosure.

### Added / Changed vs Webcam Pi

- Apple iSight enclosure compatibility
- Lets you retain the original iSight’s tilt and axial twist
- Reused original activity LED
- Optional rear Apple logo illumination
- Integrated IR shutter / privacy sensor
	- For more info about how the sensor works check out: [isight-shutter](https://github.com/elcalzado/isight-shutter)
- USB‑C breakout replaces the original connector area
- Enumerates as a UVC device named “PiSight” (instead of “Webcam Pi”) with an updated manufacturer string

## Installation

1. Download the latest image from the [Releases](https://github.com/elcalzado/pisight/releases) page.
2. Insert your microSD card into your host computer.
3. Flash the image:
	- Linux/macOS:
   ```bash
   # Replace /dev/sdX with your card device
   sudo dd if=pisight-<version>.img of=/dev/sdX
   ```
	- Windows:
   ```
   Use a tool like Balena Etcher or Raspberry Pi Imager
   ```

## Setup

![Circuit Image](circuit/pisight_circuit.png)

1. Insert the flashed microSD card into the Pi.
2. Assemble the camera (YouTube at the top video shows how I did it).
3. Plug an USB-C cable into the camera and the other end into your host USB port.
4. On your host machine, a new video device should appear.

## Building

### Prerequisites

- Linux host (WSL is fine)
- Git and buildroot dependencies

### Clone

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/elcalzado/pisight.git
cd pisight
```

### Build

```bash
# This will configure Buildroot and compile the kernel, rootfs, and image
./build.sh
```

When complete, the final SD card image will be in:

```
buildroot/output/images/sdcard.img
```

Flash it as described in [Installation](#installation).
